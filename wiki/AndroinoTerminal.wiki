==Required parts==
 * [http://arduino.cc/en/Main/Hardware Arduino board]. Tested with Pro Mini and Duemilanove boards.
 * Android mobile phone (minimum version 1.6) 
 * Sparkfun's [http://www.sparkfun.com/products/10331 Audio jack modem for android] 
 * Audio cable connector (for instance [http://www.amazon.com/Stereo-Circuit-ThinLine-Audio-Cable/dp/B004QOUGV4 TRRS audio cable])

==Hardware setup==
{{{
Pin mappings ( Modem board / Arduino pins)

FSK OUT = D5
FSK IN  = D6
VREF    = D7
}}}
.
== Software setup ==

=== Arduino sketch ===
Download and install into the arduino board the [http://androino.googlecode.com/svn-history/r85/trunk/arduino/SoftTerm/SoftTerm.pde Androino Terminal sketch].

=== Android APP===
Install the Ardroino Terminal app into the mobile phone.

== Putting all together ==

Once you have everything installed, to run the application:

 # Connect all the wires
 # Power on the arduino board
 # Open the Arduino IDE Serial Monitor
 # Start the the android App and push START/STOP button

Then, you can send messages  from android to arduino and viceversa.

== Understanding the source code ==

===Android===
The Android app starts a thread object that continuously records sound (_ArduinoService_) and 

The main classes and methods are summarized below:

 * ArduinoService: Main library thread object.
   ** AudioRecordingRun(): loop that records sound
   ** write(): 
 * FSKDecoder: Thread object that demodulates the sound signal.
   ** write(): 
   ** write(): 
 * FSKModule: Utility static methods related to FSK modulation/demodulation.
   ** encode(int):
   ** decodeSound(double[]):
